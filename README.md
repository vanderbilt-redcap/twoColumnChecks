# twoColumnChecks

This module was adapted for REDCap version 12.0.0. It has been orphaned (i.e., lacks any funding for changes), so if you'd like to adopt it, it's yours for the taking. You can change the primary author to yourself instead of Scott Pearson. I'm happy to correspond via email if there are any questions.

   *Reorients a left-vertically-aligned group of checkboxes into two columns. This will save room on a survey. 
   
   *Only works if there are more than ten checkboxes existing in the list. Note that it requires the checkbox have Left/Vertical (LV) alignment.

2.	Make sure that there is a survey in your project
